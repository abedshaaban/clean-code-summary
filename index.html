        <h1>What makes a developer a good developer?</h1>

        <p>
          Code bases can get a lot messy when you start adding features,
          functionalities, and other pages. This will also result in a messy,
          unorganized, and unclean code. Now imagine that and make your project
          a Monorepo, you will cry. So to avoid that, I will share with you some
          of the best practices, and tips, from Uncle Bob aka Mr. Clean Code.

        <h2>What is Bad code?</h2>

        <p>
          Bad code is also known as incomplete/messy code which a developer
          cannot understand its usability or functionality. In some cases, it
          would be the lack of use of good methods while writing code or the
          lack of a good description/ documentation for the code or system
          software.
        </p>

        <p>
          In many cases bad code can result in deaths such as car system
          failure, rocket software, industrial machines, ... . These failures
          would result in loss of life due to bad code in some cases or lack of
          testing. And the most concerning part is that our society now in 2023,
          cannot run without software, banks, companies, schools, governments,
          ... all need it to function normally. Otherwise, they cannot do
          anything since everything is on a server, a dedicated machine, or the
          cloud.

        <h2>What makes bad code?</h2>

        <p>
          Developers, developers make bad code due to their inconsistency and
          unplan of their feature/ project. A simple feature such as a search
          bar can take you 1-2 days to ship it to the end user. However, when
          you do that every time and ship fast, your codebase will lack
          documentation and readability. So adding a feature in the next 2 years
          would take you 6 months since your codebase is messy and changing one
          line of code may break the software. And as developers make a mess,
          the team will go slower and slower.
        </p>

        <p>
          But don't let the idea of adding more people to the project, be that
          it will be much faster to build features. It is like adding gasoline
          to a fire, They will have to understand the old messy code and they
          work with it thus adding more messy code on top of messy code. And
          that's how you get a killer code base. "The only way to go fast is to
          go well."

        <h2>What is clean code?</h2>

        <p>
          A code is clean when the code/ function does one thing well. "Code
          that reads like well-written prose." It's when developers care about
          other developers, so when you read the code you understand the
          functionality of it, without the need of external help to figure out
          what is happening. It is also when you read a code and turns out to be
          pretty much what you expected.

        <h2>Ethics of code</h2>

        <ul>
          <li>function does 1 good thing.</li>
          <li>function less than 100 lines of code.</li>
          <li>understandable code.</li>
          <li>indent.</li>
          <li>max of 3 arguments a function can take.</li>
          <li>never pass a boolean to a function.</li>
          <li>
            variable names should be inversely proportionate to the scope that
            they are being used in.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>When to use Comments?</h2>

        <p>
          Comments are used when the code cannot explain itself. Every use of a
          comment is a failure of writing good code that explains itself. It's
          an unfortunate necessity and not a great achievement.
